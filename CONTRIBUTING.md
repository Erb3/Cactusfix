# Contributing to Cactusfix

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make sure your contribution works as expected.
3. Plant that pull-request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Mozilla Public License 2.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MPL 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues tab](https://github.com/Erb3/Cactusfix/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Erb3/Cactusfix/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a good bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Four (4) spaces for indentation rather than tabs

## License
