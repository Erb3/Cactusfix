Cacti are no longer stronger than lava! Cactusfix makes items not get destroyed by cacti. It still does damage entities / players, which is intentional. Cactusfix is made for the FabricMC Minecraft modding platform.

## FAQ

**Can I use this mod in my modpack?**

Yes! You are more than welcome to include my mod in your modpack, if you credit me properly, and make downloads go thru my modrinth page.

**Does this damage players?**

Originally I made it so players don't take damage, but I decided to remove this for the 1.0.0 release.

**This is such a easy mod to make. Why did you even bother making this?!?**

I was browsing thru Modrinth looking for a new project to work on, then I relised there was no mod that simply disabled cacti stealing your items. So I made this mod in half an hour.

**Plz updat to forge**

I won't update to forge, as I have never touched it, and have no plan to do so.

**Will you update this to new MC versions?**

If I feel like it :)
